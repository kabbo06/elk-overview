# Distributed Log Management System using ELK Stack
A distributed log management system based on the ELK Stack is a powerful solution for organizations dealing with large volumes of log data. The ELK Stack, consisting of Elasticsearch, Logstash, and Kibana, provides the necessary tools for efficient log management. Elasticsearch offers real-time search and analytics capabilities, Logstash handles data ingestion and processing, and Kibana enables data visualization and exploration. Together, they form a robust ecosystem that allows organizations to collect, analyze, and gain valuable insights from logs generated by multiple sources. This distributed approach enhances scalability, performance, and flexibility in managing log data effectively. 
Establishing an effective and distributed log management system requires four major components. The inherent cluster environment ensures high availability as the system operates by default. These components include:
-	Data Collection
-	Data Analysis
-	Data Visualization
-	Notification and Alerting
