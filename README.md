# Distributed Log Management System using ELK Stack
A distributed log management system based on the ELK Stack is a powerful solution for organizations dealing with large volumes of log data. The ELK Stack, consisting of Elasticsearch, Logstash, and Kibana, provides the necessary tools for efficient log management. Elasticsearch offers real-time search and analytics capabilities, Logstash handles data ingestion and processing, and Kibana enables data visualization and exploration. Together, they form a robust ecosystem that allows organizations to collect, analyze, and gain valuable insights from logs generated by multiple sources. This distributed approach enhances scalability, performance, and flexibility in managing log data effectively. 
Establishing an effective and distributed log management system requires four major components. The inherent cluster environment ensures high availability as the system operates by default. These components include:
-	Data Collection
-	Data Analysis
-	Data Visualization
-	Notification and Alerting
# Log Data Collection
In the ELK Stack, data collection is primarily handled by the Logstash component. Logstash is an open-source data processing pipeline that collects, parses, and transforms data from various sources before sending it to Elasticsearch for indexing and storage.
Logstash provides a wide range of input plugins that enable data collection from different sources.
Some commonly used input plugins include File, Beats, Syslog, TCP/UDP, HTTP, JDBC, Kafka, Amazon S3, and Redis among others.

Logstash, being a flexible data processing pipeline, can collect and process various types of data. Some common types of data that can be collected via Logstash include:
- **Log Files:** Logstash is commonly used to collect log files generated by applications, servers, network devices, and operating systems. These logs can provide valuable insights for troubleshooting, monitoring, and analyzing system behavior.
- **Metrics:** Logstash can collect metrics data from systems, applications, and infrastructure components. This includes performance metrics such as CPU usage, memory usage, network traffic, disk utilization, and more. Collecting metrics allows for monitoring system health and identifying performance bottlenecks.
- **Events:** Logstash can collect event data, which can be structured or unstructured. Events can include user actions, system events, sensor data, IoT device data, or any other type of timestamped data generated by different sources.
- **Security Logs:** Logstash is commonly used for collecting security-related logs such as firewall logs, intrusion detection system (IDS) logs, access logs, authentication logs, and audit logs. Collecting and analyzing these logs helps in identifying security incidents, detecting anomalies, and investigating security breaches.
- **Application Data:** Logstash can collect application-specific data, including application logs, transaction logs, API logs, error logs, and debug logs. Analyzing application data can provide insights into application performance, user behavior, and error patterns.
- **Database Logs:** Logstash can ingest logs generated by databases, such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, or Oracle, enabling centralized storage and analysis of database-related activities, queries, and errors.
- **Web Server Logs:** Logstash can collect logs from web servers like Apache or Nginx. These logs contain information about HTTP requests, response codes, user agents, IP addresses, and other valuable data for web analytics, troubleshooting, and security analysis.
  
These are just a few examples and Logstash can collect data from numerous other sources and formats. Logstash's versatility and extensibility make it a powerful tool for collecting and processing data from diverse systems and applications within an organization.
