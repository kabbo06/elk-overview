# Distributed Log Management System using ELK Stack
A distributed log management system based on the ELK Stack is a powerful solution for organizations dealing with large volumes of log data. The ELK Stack, consisting of Elasticsearch, Logstash, and Kibana, provides the necessary tools for efficient log management. Elasticsearch offers real-time search and analytics capabilities, Logstash handles data ingestion and processing, and Kibana enables data visualization and exploration. Together, they form a robust ecosystem that allows organizations to collect, analyze, and gain valuable insights from logs generated by multiple sources. This distributed approach enhances scalability, performance, and flexibility in managing log data effectively. 
Establishing an effective and distributed log management system requires four major components. The inherent cluster environment ensures high availability as the system operates by default. These components include:
-	Data Collection
-	Data Analysis
-	Data Visualization
-	Notification and Alerting
# Log Data Collection
In the ELK Stack, data collection is primarily handled by the Logstash component. Logstash is an open-source data processing pipeline that collects, parses, and transforms data from various sources before sending it to Elasticsearch for indexing and storage.
Logstash provides a wide range of input plugins that enable data collection from different sources.
Some commonly used input plugins include File, Beats, Syslog, TCP/UDP, HTTP, JDBC, Kafka, Amazon S3, and Redis among others.
